#### .vscode/settings.json (2,140 bytes)
- **Purpose**: VS Code workspace settings

--glass-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)  /* Glass shadows */
```

## AI Model Detection Tool

### Purpose
The `test-final-detection.js` tool is designed to accurately detect the active AI model being used in VS Code. It reads directly from the VS Code SQLite storage database to ensure high confidence in its results.

### Usage Instructions
1. **Navigate to the Tool Directory**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the tool:
     ```bash
     cd "H:\-EMBLEM-PROJECT(s)-\Tools\packages\vscode-ai-model-detector\mcp-server"
     ```

2. **Run the Tool**:
   - Execute the following command to run the detection script:
     ```bash
     node .\test-final-detection.js
     ```

3. **View the Results**:
   - The tool will output detailed information about the active AI model, including:
     - **Model ID**: The unique identifier for the model.
     - **Model Name**: The name of the model.
     - **Vendor**: The organization providing the model (e.g., OpenAI).
     - **Capabilities**: Features supported by the model (e.g., chat, code generation).
     - **Confidence**: The confidence level of the detection.
     - **Source**: The data source used for detection.

### Example Output
```
✅ DETECTION RESULT:
Current Model: {
  id: 'copilot/gpt-4o',
  name: 'copilot/gpt-4o',
  vendor: 'OpenAI',
  family: 'gpt',
  maxTokens: 100000,
  capabilities: [ 'chat', 'code_generation' ]
}
```

### Benefits
- **High Confidence**: The tool directly reads from VS Code's internal state, ensuring accurate results.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Identifies the currently active model, not just available options.
- **Comprehensive Output**: Provides detailed information about the model's capabilities and vendor.

Use this tool whenever you need to verify the active AI model in your VS Code environment.
